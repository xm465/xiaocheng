The charts are from a 2020 report on Elder Fraud.（https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf）

## Step two - Critique the data visualization

I gave the chart a 6 for its usefulness. The readers of the report and the charts can be both government officials, police, and also lay people who care about the topic. The chart is useful in a way that it shows an increasing trend in elder fraud cases. I deduct points because the title is not clear enough so it will not be as useful as if it has a clear title. 
I gave an 8 for it’s completeness because it is completed, but still can be improved and need some fixation. I gave a 5 on its perceptibility because people got confused when just looking directly at the chart. It can represent other crimes like theft or robbery. I gave it a 5 because I think the visualization type is appropriate. 
The chart did well on its truthfulness so I gave it a 9. Intuitively, I think it’s easy to get the idea that there are more and more victims, but the audience would probably be confused about what type of victims are they, so I gave it a 7. I gave the chart a 4 on its aesthetics because it can do more with it’s use of color. It can be more engaging so I only give it a 3 for it's engagement. 

I think the data visualization is clear and not distracting anyone with too much information.  It works well by putting the counts of victims and losses side by side. However, there are still some flaws with the charts. First, the title is somewhat confusing to me. "OVER 60 VICTIM" actually refers to the age, however, I am more likely to relate it to the number of counts. The title can be clearer and needs less interpretation. Secondly, I would like to change the color of the charts, since the color green reminds me of something nice and positive. Moreover, the dollar amount on the second graph is overwhelming for me to read, and I would probably reduce the zeros and change the unit.   

The primary audience would be people who work for the government and the FBI because they use the data to monitor crimes and find out ways to eliminate the crimes.  I think it works because it sends out the information that there are more victims over 60 years old in the year 2020 than in the previous 5 years. The chart itself is not hard to comprehend, while the line charts and bar charts give distinct trends. 

I think this method is generally successful, but still can be improved. 
1. I would change the color of the second graph to red to indicate losses. For the first graph, I would like to use color to highlight the increase in victims from 2019 to 2020.
2. I would like to change to title of the charts as well as the labels of the second graph.
