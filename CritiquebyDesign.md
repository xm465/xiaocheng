## Step one

The charts are from a 2020 report on Elder Fraud.（https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf）

## Step two - Critique the data visualization

I gave the chart a 6 for its usefulness. The readers of the report and the charts can be both government officials, police, and also lay people who care about the topic. The chart is useful in a way that it shows an increasing trend in elder fraud cases. I deduct points because the title is not clear enough so it will not be as useful as if it has a clear title. 
I gave an 8 for it’s completeness because it is completed, but still can be improved and need some fixation. I gave a 5 on its perceptibility because people got confused when just looking directly at the chart. It can represent other crimes like theft or robbery. I gave it a 5 because I think the visualization type is appropriate. 
The chart did well on its truthfulness so I gave it a 9. Intuitively, I think it’s easy to get the idea that there are more and more victims, but the audience would probably be confused about what type of victims are they, so I gave it a 7. I gave the chart a 4 on its aesthetics because it can do more with it’s use of color. It can be more engaging so I only give it a 3 for it's engagement. 

I think the data visualization is clear and not distracting anyone with too much information.  It works well by putting the counts of victims and losses side by side. However, there are still some flaws with the charts. First, the title is somewhat confusing to me. "OVER 60 VICTIM" actually refers to the age, however, I am more likely to relate it to the number of counts. The title can be clearer and needs less interpretation. Secondly, I would like to change the color of the charts, since the color green reminds me of something nice and positive. Moreover, the dollar amount on the second graph is overwhelming for me to read, and I would probably reduce the zeros and change the unit.   

The primary audience would be people who work for the government and the FBI because they use the data to monitor crimes and find out ways to eliminate the crimes.  I think it works because it sends out the information that there are more victims over 60 years old in the year 2020 than in the previous 5 years. The chart itself is not hard to comprehend, while the line charts and bar charts give distinct trends. 

I think this method is generally successful, but still can be improved. 
1. I would change the color of the second graph to red to indicate losses. For the first graph, I would like to highlight the increase in victims from 2019 to 2020.
2. I would like to change to title of the charts as well as the labels of the second graph. 

## Step three - Sketch out a solution




First, I have added the title for both charts to make them more meaningful and easy to follow. The focus for the first chart is on its dramatic increase from 2019 - 2020, therefore I emphasized this in the title. For the primary audience who are the police officials work for the government, they should probably pay more attention to this recent drastic increase in elder fraud victims. The graph is more engaging to them, and they might want to explore more on what causes such increases after reading the charts. 

Second, I change the color from green to red and yellow. Because people would relate green to more positive events, instead of fraud victims. By changing the color, the charts would make more sense to the lay audience intuitively. 

Moreover, I changed the labels on the y-axis of both charts to make it easier to read. I have also labelled each bar accordingly. For the first chart, I labelled the number of victims in 2020 to enhance the title. 

## Step four: Test the solution

I have asked 2 student in mid 20s and a friend in mid 30s. All of them think that the change in the titles really helps them to follow the meaning of the graphs. One of them mentioned that she initially thought the graph is about other crimes when she looked at the old design of the chart, and the new version is more straightforward in conveying the theme. They all think that the color change worked well. 

One of them thinks that the y-axis for the first chart has been lifted too high and the starting point should not be 0. There is too much blank under the line chart. One of my classmate said that I can use shades of colors to highlight this year's dramatic increase in victims. She suggest me to also label the victim numbers in 2019 to make the contrast. 

## Step five - Final visualization

For the final visualization, I have hilighted the dramatic change between 2019 - 2020 with the use of color red and the label of the number of victims in each year. The y-axis starts from 50k, which eliminate the blank space under the line chart and I think it works well. I have also label the min and max losses in the second chart, which shows people how big the differences in losses for the past 5 years.
