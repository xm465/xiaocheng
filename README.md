# About me
My name is Cheng, I use she/her pronouns and I am a second year Masters of Arts Management student at CMU. I did my undergraduate studies in Economics and Art History. I have worked as a quanlitative analyst of social intelligence for for-profit firms and now I hope my data-analytic skills can help museums and cultural organizations in the non-profit sector.  

## What I hope to learn
I hope I can understand how to choose appropriate forms of data visualization methodology for different sets of data. 
I would also like to train myself until I have the intuition of using the right graph for various purposes. 
The use of color is important in telling story with data, and I woud like to try out different color schemes in this course to see how the color schemes would affect the stroytelling. 
With all the data visualization and storytelling technique I will be learning, I hope I can walk out of this class with the skills to help arts and cultural organizations to reach boarder audience and achieve social justice.
