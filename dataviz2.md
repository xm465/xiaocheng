## Government Debt to Ratio Rate in % Around the World

I choose to do a heating map for my third data visualization because it allows us to see the ratio rates of different countries over the years side by side. By inserting a heating map, I use the same color scheme but in different shades. The darker the shade is, the higher the debt ratio is. It gives the reader a sense of which country has the highest debt ratio just by giving a glimpse of the graph. The previous graph gives each country's government debt ratio trend, which is really clear for someone looking for the trend for an individual country. However, one would not easily compare the trends of different countries. The heating map can have the audience compare different governments' performances easily by observing the shades of the blocks.
