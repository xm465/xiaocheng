# Updates made since previous two parts 
For the hierarchy chart that reflects the reasons why people abandon their pets, I changed it from circles to treemap. This is one of the most important data visualizations of my presentation. Initially, I was thinking of using a bar chart and putting the cat owners' and dog owners' responses put side by side. However, after seeing some of our classmatesâ€™ presentations this Tuesday, I found out that bar charts with too much-written information are hard to read during seconds of demonstrations. Therefore, I choose to use treemap to do the data visualization because it gives a clear hierarchy scale and demonstrates what the top reasons are. Moreover, because I change the graph to a treemap, I am able to enlarge the labelings. The problem with small labels was mentioned by my interviewees during part II, therefore in part III, I made sure that labels are clear and concise for the audience to understand.
My audience is those who are pet owners and those who will be potential pet owners. In the storytelling section, one of my interviewees suggested that I need to say something about animals in the shelter getting euthanized to make the audience more aware of the issue. Even though the number of shelter animals getting euthanized is decreasing because of the effort of many animal-saving nonprofit organizations, I still include the graph because the number is still high. By having this graph, my audience will get the information that abandoning animals will possibly lead to their death. 
I made radar charts for consideration when people looking for new pets. There are multiple age groups so I made four radar charts, while they worked in a way, one of my classmates reminds me that in the merged version of the radar charts, some color-blind people may have a difficult time distinguishing red and green radar charts. In my part III, I changed the radar chart color to make each group more distinguishable. The issue with red and green sometimes will be easily ignored, especially for separate radar charts.
