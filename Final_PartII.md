| Queations                                                     |Answers        | 
| ---------------------------------------                       |--------------:|
| Does my story make sense?                                     | yes |
| Do the visualization help you understand the story?           | yes, the bar chart and pie chart help understand and explain the topics well      |
| What worked?                                                  | The topic and questioning of investigation are very exciting along with the clear data visualization, seeing more firsthand and secondary research would be more obvious to move forward the research depth. The structure also works well such as titles, headlines, questions with answers.       |
| Who do you think is the audience?                             | - The audience would mainly be shelter employees(managers), potential cat/dog adopters, veterinary, social workers etc.  |
| Do you think the message is clear for the potential audience? |I think overall the message reveals well the aspects of data and infographics.      |
| What didn’t work?                                             | - Some background graphics would be more related to the topic (I know some from the templates lol), infographics (charts) could be more consistent with legends/fonts/colors to make it easy to read.      |
| What would you change? Any suggestions for improvement?       | - More real photos from the shelter/adopter/vet to support the investigation; More consistent titles and charts highlighting the insights conclusion of each chapter.      |
| What question do you have after reading this?   What made you curious?                | - Through reading the age charts, I’m curious about more categories like locations(states), genders(LGBTQ),the differences between cats and dogs, social/ethical/regional patterns of abandonment.     |
|What new inspiration arose? What surprised you?                | - I’m very surprised to see how abandonments have been happening during recent years, more often people care about adoption brings happiness on the light side, but we do need to emphasize the whole lifecycle and process of animal life through improving our mechanism of shelter adoption, which could lower the abandonment rate. We could provide more useful methods like better return policies, and better match/probation between animals and appropriate adopters.     |
