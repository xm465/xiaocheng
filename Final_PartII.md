## Final Project Part TWO

# Wireframing and Storyboards 

My wire framing and story boards is on [shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/yvJMiryElZ3AOshn).

# User research and interviews

The target audience would be people who want to be a pet owner or ready to adopt/purchase pets. I hope the story would make them more careful about their decision making in adopting pets. The secondary audience could be vets, social workers, and shelter works because they would be able to communicate with potential pet adopter and tell them about pros, cons, and things to consider. 

My first interviewee is an architect who owns three cat. She has a friend who recently returned a pet to the shelter.

| Queations                                                     |Answers        | 
| ---------------------------------------                       |--------------:|
| Does my story make sense?                                     | yes |
| Do the visualization help you understand the story?           | yes, the bar chart and pie chart help understand and explain the topics well      |
| What worked?                                                  | The topic and questioning of investigation are very exciting along with the clear data visualization, seeing more firsthand and secondary research would be more obvious to move forward the research depth. The structure also works well such as titles, headlines, questions with answers.       |
| Who do you think is the audience?                             | The audience would mainly be shelter employees(managers), potential cat/dog adopters, veterinary, social workers etc.  |
| Do you think the message is clear for the potential audience? |I think overall the message reveals well the aspects of data and infographics.      |
| What didn’t work?                                             | Some background graphics would be more related to the topic (I know some from the templates lol), infographics (charts) could be more consistent with legends/fonts/colors to make it easy to read.      |
| What would you change? Any suggestions for improvement?       | More real photos from the shelter/adopter/vet to support the investigation; More consistent titles and charts highlighting the insights conclusion of each chapter.      |
| What question do you have after reading this?   What made you curious?                | Through reading the age charts, I’m curious about more categories like locations(states), genders(LGBTQ),the differences between cats and dogs, social/ethical/regional patterns of abandonment.     |
|What new inspiration arose? What surprised you?                |  I’m very surprised to see how abandonments have been happening during recent years, more often people care about adoption brings happiness on the light side, but we do need to emphasize the whole lifecycle and process of animal life through improving our mechanism of shelter adoption, which could lower the abandonment rate. We could provide more useful methods like better return policies, and better match/probation between animals and appropriate adopters.     |

My second interviewee is a social worker who care about people and animals.

| Queations                                                     |Answers        | 
| ---------------------------------------                       |--------------:|
| Does my story make sense?                                     | Yes. The story is about the prevention of abandonment of pets.|
| Do the visualization help you understand the story?           | Yes. Images of cute puppies help readers to better empathize with pets facing potential abandonment, and thus make the topic more relevant for the audience. The structure and the presentation of statistics also help with the narration of the story, making it more convincing for the audience. |
| What worked?                                                  | The visualized statistics shows how severe the problem of abandoning pets is, and presents quite clearly the reasons behind such phenomenon. The structure of the narration is also well designed for audience to follow the story. The most exciting part  would be the comparison between the reasons of having a a pet and abandoning a pet. This tells directly what owners should consider before adopting or purchasing a pet.    |
| Who do you think is the audience?                             | The audience would be people who are pet owners and potential pet owners.   |
| Do you think the message is clear for the potential audience? |I think the message is pretty clear.      |
| What didn’t work?                                             | There are several blank spaces between each subsections of the story. I am not sure why it is designed this way.      |
| What would you change? Any suggestions for improvement?       | I would eliminated the blank spaces and make the story more compact. The story could also include more kinds of pets, rather than just dogs and cats.    |
| What question do you have after reading this?   What made you curious?                | I am curious on whether or not there could be a more effective way to make people adopt the abandoned pets. Sometimes there would be unexpected problems emerging for pet owners, in such cases, persuading them to not abandon pets seems inadequate.    |
|What new inspiration arose? What surprised you?                | I am surprised by the amount of pets abandoned by their owners. It is rarely discussed in online forums of pet lovers. I think maybe we could also work on how to  establish an environment comfortable enough to talk about the problems and frustrations of raising a pet, this way owners might not make the decision so quickly.  |

My third interviewee is a classmate who told me once that she wants to adopt a dog.

| Queations                                                     |Answers        | 
| ---------------------------------------                       |--------------:|
| Does my story make sense?                                     | Yes. |
| Do the visualization help you understand the story?           | Yes. I think first of all the pictures of puppies help me to engage with the topic. The different types of data visualization help me understand how severe the problem is.|
| What worked?                                                  | I think the radio chart is really effective to show how different age group's concerns on adopting pets. The most exciting part is the overlapping radio chart, which shows that old generation really cares about the temperament of the pets and medical records of the pet. It makes a lot more sense because people probably caremore about health issues when they grow older.  |
| Who do you think is the audience?                             | The audience would be pet owners and people who want to have pets like me.  |
| Do you think the message is clear for the potential audience? | Yes, I can tell that I should be more careful     |
| What didn’t work?                                             | There can be more words to explain the graphs and charts. Maybe not long, just one or two sentence would do. Some of the legends are not big enough.   |
| What would you change? Any suggestions for improvement?       | I would change the legends and label size and add more words to the website.  |
| What question do you have after reading this?   What made you curious?                | I have a thought that some of the survey data can be biased bacause some people would be ashamed to reveal the fact that they abandon their pets. Especially for those who just “Unwant” their pet. I am curious if the real number of abandonment will be higher. |
|What new inspiration arose? What surprised you?                | I am surprised by the decreasing number of euthanasized animal, especially in 2020 the year of pandemic. I would like to know the abandon rate during the peak of the pandemic. I think there should be more abandonments during that hard time. |

# Interview feedback

All interviewees understand the story and can follow the story with the data visualization wells. When I first showed the unfinished version of my story to one of my classmates, she told me that I could add the consequences of having too many pets in the shelter. Therefore I added the number of pets that were put to death in recent years to make the story flow with more emotion. Some of the suggestions are on the choices of the pictures, backgrounds, alignment of the website and the leftover space on the website. I still need more time to play with the shorthand to make it easier  for audience to follow. I will definitly spend time on this part to make it perfect in my final presentation. I received some suggestions on the label and legend sizes of my data visualizations, and I plan to make more adjustments on these graphs in my part III. My interviewees are curious about social/ethical/regional patterns of abandonment which I think is really ineresting. Many ideas and suggestions they gave in the last two questions are so valuble that I will add these to my call to action part.
