# Final Project

## Outline


Every year, millions of pets have been adopted, but unfortunately, there are also a great number of pets that are abandoned or lost and enter shelters. It is always exciting to adopt a new creature to your household, however, statistics show the rate to return or abandon pets to animal shelters is not low.  In this final project, I would like to show the following aspects by creating charts using data:

First, I would like to give a background on how many pets are entering shelters in the US, and among which, how many are left or returned by their previous owner. In other words, I would like to show what percentage of pets are abandoned by their owners intentionally. 

Second, I will use data to show some of the main reasons for people abandon their pets. I would like to show these reasons in a pie chart so that the audience will be able to see what are the major reasons and what factors are not as important as others. 

In conclusion, I will give suggestions on how to prepare yourself to be a better pet owner that can reduce the abandonment rate. Moreover, what factors does one need to consider before adopting or purchasing a pet? 


## Initial sketches

The first sketch shows the percentage of pets were abandoned and left by their owners to the shelter. The number corresponding to the percentage is huge, which is 2 million. I highlighted this number on my graph as well to give the audience an impression that this could be a huge problem and contribute to a lot of extra labors and costs to the animal shelters.

The second graph is a donut graph of the main reasons for people to abandon their pets. 

## The data

I use this data source to generate background data visualizations to tell the audience basic information such as how many pets enter the shelter annually in the US, and among them, how many are abandoned by their owners.

This is the statictics of reasons for pet abandonment in spain. The original data source forms a bar chart, but because the chart shows the percentage of different reasons, I will use the data to generate a pie/donut chart to better demonstrate the percentage.

In this article, the author used and listed a lot of data to show reasons for pet abandonment in different parts of the world. I will use these data to generate more pie charts to see different reasons for owners in different countries to abandon pets.

## Method and medium

I will be useing Shorthand as the medium to present my final project. I think a website can include all my research findings, but I will not neccessarily read all the contents I put on the website. Instead, I will follow the outline I planned above to select contents and present.
